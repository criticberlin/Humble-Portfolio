            <h3>About me<br><span>I am Mohamed Ahmed Shoieb, an intermediate software developer based in 10th of Ramadan City, Sharqia, Egypt. Born in Bilbies City, I am currently pursuing my studies at the Faculty of Computer Science at El Sewedy University of Technology, Egypt, having successfully completed my first year.

                I have developed proficiency in several programming languages, including Python and Java, with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming. My skill set extends to database management, basic networking, and 3D modeling using tools like AutoCAD and Unreal Engine 5. Additionally, I am adept at designing using Canva, Photoshop, PicsArt, Lightroom, Snapseed, and Illustrator, along with a basic understanding of video editing.
                
                I possess significant experience in utilizing Office programs, especially in crafting professional presentations on PowerPoint. While I have a comprehensive knowledge of both software and hardware, my primary expertise lies in software development.
                
                I am also passionate about volunteer work and student activities, having participated in IEEE at Shorouk Academy. In my leisure time, I enjoy playing ping pong and am a professional guitarist specializing in the electric guitar, with a deep appreciation for rock, metal, and jazz music.</span></h3>
